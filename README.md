# Advent of Code

My first fumbling steps in coding Go!

After soon 20 years of mostly C#, it's about time to try out a new language.

Advent of Code is a great challenge when learning a new language. You're forced to explore and learn many different aspects of a language. From how to work with the basic stuff, like variables, files, loops, conditions etc, to how to organize the code into a whole project.

I'm just beginning to learn; by googling, reading articles, looking at code and most importantly: a lot of trial'n'error!

My language coding history so far:

* 2003-2021 - C# .NET, with some TypeScript & Angular
* 1999-2003 - Java on OpenStep, WebObjects & J2EE
* 1996-1999 - Object-C on NeXTStep & OpenStep
* 1990-1995 - Turbo Pascal, LISP, C & C++
* 1986-1990 - 68k Assembly Language on Amiga
* 1983-1986 - Z80 Assembly Language on ZX Spectrum
